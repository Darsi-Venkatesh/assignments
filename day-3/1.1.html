    <h3>CHICKEN RECIPE</h3><br>
    <p>We’ve all heard the adage "chicken: it's what's for dinner," and it’s true: chicken breasts, thighs (our favorite cut), or even a whole bird all have a spot on our kitchen table. Unfortunately, that can mean falling into a dinner rut much too easily for our liking. If you’re like us and just can’t bear to make your (or your family’s) old standbys for the umpteenth time, we’ve got you. Get inspired with our list of our 85 best chicken dinner recipes—you’ll be sure to find a new weeknight favorite.
We’ve got something here for everyone, whether you’re looking for tried-and-true classics or creative recipes the whole family will love. If you’re only ordering dishes like chicken Parmesan, chicken tikka masala, or cashew chicken when you’re out at a restaurant, consider this your kick in the pants to try your hand at making them at home. We’ve tested our recipes over and over to make sure they’re easy to follow, and will result in chef-worthy dinners (even if you’re only a novice in the kitchen).
Looking for something more outside the box? Take flavor combinations you love, then turn ‘em into a chicken dinner. We’ve included our jalapeño popper chicken skillet, our enchilada casserole, our chicken shawarma bowls, our tequila lime chicken thighs, and more here to get your creative juices flowing. Got an idea, but not sure how to execute it? Let us know in the comments below, and we’ll see what we can do to help get you there.
And don’t forget about your grill! Now that the weather’s warming up, it’s time to dust yours (or just your indoor grill pan) off, and start enjoying your chicken dinners al fresco. Our spicy coconut grilled chicken, our paella-inspired party packs, and our bruschetta chicken are great places to start, then check out our best grilled chicken recipes for even more ideas. Don’t worry, we’ve got tons of sides for grilled chicken too, and all the potato salads, pasta salads, and summery salads you’ll need to serve alongside them all summer long.

    <H3>EGG CURRY</H3><BR>

    <pre>
    <p>
    PREPARATION
    Step 1:
    In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil over medium. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until evenly caramelized and light brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in the garlic and ginger, and fry, stirring occasionally, another 4 minutes. Add the cinnamon and cardamom. When the spices start to toast, after about 2 minutes, stir in the coriander, turmeric and peppercorns.
    Step 2:
    Add the tomatoes, salt and 1 cup water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and the fat rises to the top, about 15 minutes. Stir in the garam masala and lower the heat. If the sauce isn’t runny, stir in ½ cup water.
    Step 3:
    Add all but 2 of the eggs and stir gently. Halve the remaining eggs lengthwise and arrange on top, yolk-side up. Heat until the eggs are warmed through, then top with cilantro.</p></font>

    <h3>MUTTON CURRY</h3>
    <p>
    But this easy mutton curry recipe is different. What I love about this recipe is that it requires very little prep, uses simple, everyday ingredients and is ready in under an hour. If you’re wondering how, I’ve got you! I have simply replaced long hours of prep and marination with a store-bought mutton curry masala and it has been a complete game changer! This means that my lamb curry is now ready in half the original time without any compromise on taste! The result - a heartwarming mutton curry that’s homely, spicy and a total flavour bomb!

    <h3>FISH</h3>
    <p>
        This Goan Fish Curry recipe is marginally more involved than most of the basic homestyle and online recipes you’ll see which typically have thin sauces and lack real depth of flavour in the sauce. This version specifically aims to achieve the same character and layers of flavour like you get at good Indian restaurants.

Specifically, this is a copycat of Malabar South Indian Restaurant in Crows Nest, Sydney, a long standing institution known for its excellent authentic Southern Indian food!
