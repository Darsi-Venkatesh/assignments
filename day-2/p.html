3. An essential component in weight loss programs 


Unlike other sources of fat, Paneer contains short chains of fatty acids that are easily digestible. This means, the fat instead of getting deposited, is digested and broken down to release energy. Stored fat is the main reason for obesity. Thus, Paneer is a highly recommended fatty acid source for people who are fitness freaks or those who undergo weight loss programs.

4. Aids in the normal functioning of the digestive system 


The digestive system is an important organ system in the human body. It breaks down the food we consume to provide energy. A defect in the digestive system hinders the normal functioning of the other systems. Paneer contains a very high amount of minerals like phosphorus and magnesium, both of which are essential for the smooth functioning of the digestive system. Magnesium acts as a laxative, whereas phosphorus aids in digestion as well as excretion processes.
