As a result of a phenomenal domestic season and his performances in 2022 IPL season, Patidar was named in the One-Day International (ODI) squad for the series against South Africa in the month of October.[15] Later in February 2023 he was named in the ODI squad against New Zealand as an injury replacement for Shreyas Iyer.[16] However he failed to make it to the playing eleven on both the occasions.

He made his ODI debut on 21 December 2023 against South Africa, where he scored 22 runs in 16 balls.

In January 2024, he was named as a replacement for Virat Kohli in India's squad for the first two matches of the test series against England. He made his Test debut on 2 February 2024 in the second match of the series, scoring 32 and 9 runs in the first and second innings, respectively.[17][18][19]
