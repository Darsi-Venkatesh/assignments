In its most simple form, dosa is crispy and crepe-like and is a very popular street food in India. Dosa is famous for its simple ingredients and savory, slightly bitter flavor. It can be eaten as a snack, breakfast, or anytime you’re in the mood for a delicious, savory meal! 

Originating in southern India, the crispy dosa has been around since the 5th century AD. It’s said that dosa was first referenced by Chalukya King Somesvara III in Tamil literature in 1054 AD. Like many Indian foods, dosa varies depending on region and occasion.
