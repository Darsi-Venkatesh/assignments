Karthik played in the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League as wicket-keeper for the Delhi Daredevils, scoring 145 runs with the bat at 24.16 and a strike rate[27] of 135.51.[28] His highest score was an unbeaten 56 to steer Daredevils to a five-wicket win in a group match against the Mumbai Indians.[6] In the 2009 edition hosted by South Africa, Karthik played in each of Daredevils' 15 matches. He scored 288 runs at 36.00, passing 40 on three occasions and making 17 dismissals. Although Daredevils topped the tournament's pool stage, Karthik made only nine in the semi-final and his team were defeated by six wickets by the Deccan Chargers.[6]

Karthik was bought by Kings XI Punjab in 2011 for US$900,000, making him the second-most-expensive player on their squad. For the 2012 season, Karthik joined Mumbai Indians for a reported US$2.35 million.[29] He played with Mumbai Indians for two seasons (2012, 2013), winning the title in 2013. Karthik was instrumental in his team's campaign; he scored 510 runs at 28.33. Karthik refused to be retained by Mumbai Indians ahead of the 2014 personnel changes, a move that later recalled as being a "regret".[30] He was bought by Delhi Daredevils. In 2015, he moved to Royal Challengers Bangalore and in 2016, to Gujarat Lions, who retained him for the 2017 season. Karthik was named wicket-keeper of the IPL XI of the tournament for that season by CricBuzz.[31] He was bought by the Kolkata Knight Riders for the 2018 season (replacing Gautam Gambhir), and led the team to the playoffs.[32] For his performance in the 2018 IPL season, Karthik was named to the ESPNcricinfo and CricBuzz IPL XI.[33][34]

In 2020, halfway through the season Karthik relinquished the captaincy to Eoin Morgan.[35] The team could, however, win only three off their seven matches in the second half and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the second season in a row.[36] Karthik managed to score only 223 runs and enforce seven dismissals in 2021 edition.[37] He ended his Kolkata Knight Riders stint as the second most successful captain of the franchise only behind Gautam Gambhir.

In the 2022 auctions, Karthik was bought by the Royal Challengers Bangalore for â‚¹5.50 crore.[38] He managed to score 330 runs in 16 matches with an average of 55.00 and a strike rate of 183.33.[39] He had a poor 2023 campaign with the bat, scoring only 140 runs with an average of just above 11. Ahead of the following edition, the media speculated that it was going to be his final season in the IPL.[40] Karthik began the season strongly and scored two consecutive half-centuries, against Mumbai Indians and Sunrisers Hyderabad respectively. However, his team ended losing both matches.[41] The latter innings was a 35-ball 83, in a chase of 288, which included five fours and seven sixes.
