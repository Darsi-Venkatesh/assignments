The world is obsessed with fried chicken. But it collectively missed out on the Indian fried chicken experience. I have a love hate relationship with watching people order Indian food and its always butter chicken. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with butter chicken, but its time the world tries foods from other regions of India, because Indian food is incredibly diverse. One such dish, is Chicken 65 from the southern part of India. Invented in Chennai, this version of fried chicken represents the flavours of southern India – a perfect balance of sweet, sour and spicy.

The name as to why it is called 65, has a few lores behind it. But experts say it’s not the date, rather the serial number on the menu card that gave this iconic dish its name. Chicken 65 was named either because it was invented in 1965, or because it was the 65th item in the menu card.
