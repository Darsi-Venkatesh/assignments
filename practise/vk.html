Kohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. Kohli is known as a skilled batsman who plays with determination and energy. In one-day cricket, he usually bats at number three and stands with his chest slightly open and holds the bottom of his bat firmly. He's praised for his quick footwork, wide range of shots, and his talent for leading innings, especially in high-pressure situations. Instead of trying to hit big shots, Kohli prefers to play safe shots close to the ground. People admire his ability to make wrist shots and consistently perform well in the mid-wicket and cover areas. Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning.[6]

However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[7] Bowlers often make use of this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches. This weakness has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on many occasions. Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman and former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,[8] and former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly exposed to out-swinging deliveries.[9]
